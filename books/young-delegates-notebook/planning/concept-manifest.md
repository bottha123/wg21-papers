# Concept Manifest - A Young Delegate's Notebook

Binding contract for every writing agent. Read this before drafting any chapter.

## How to use this manifest

- Each chapter OWNS the terms listed under it. A term is defined once (bolded, in plain language) in its owning section.
- Never use a term formally before its owning section. If you need a concept owned by a later chapter, paraphrase it in plain words and do not claim the formal definition.
- When you use a term first defined in an earlier chapter, restate its meaning in a short parenthetical on first use in your chapter.
- Section numbers are decimal. Chapter headings are `## N. Title`, sections `### N.M Title`, subsections `#### N.M.K Title`. Headings carry the number, no section symbol. In prose, references use the symbol (§5.2).

## The anatomy bridge (important)

The chapter order introduces papers (Ch 3) and remote participation (Ch 4) before the full structural map (Ch 5). To avoid forward references, Chapter 2 introduces the committee's basic anatomy at a shallow level: WG21, National Body, convener, plenary, subgroup. Chapter 5 owns the deep structural treatment (the specific rooms, study groups, the Direction Group, chair power) and restates each shared term with a parenthetical. Writers in Ch 3-4 use only the shallow Ch 2 meanings.

## Cross-cutting psychological awareness

Woven in, never its own topic, never jargon. Advice TO the reader about their own judgment. Placed in: Ch 1 (responsibility, not a game), Ch 6 (realistic expectations), Ch 7 (don't get addicted; stay skeptical), Ch 8 (consensus is social pressure; demand evidence), Ch 9 (evidence over enthusiasm), Ch 11 (burnout; boundaries), Ch 13 (participation is not impact).

## Chapter 1 - The C++ Standard

Arc: enters curious about "what is this thing," leaves feeling the weight and seriousness of it.

Subheading order:
- 1.1 Standardization Is a Responsibility (not a hobby, resume item, or game)
- 1.2 The Delegate's Oath
- 1.3 Every Feature Is Forever (the standard only grows; std::regex; ABI locks mistakes; nothing can be removed)
- 1.4 The People Who Inherit Your Work (sixteen million users)
- 1.5 The Standard Is Not the Language (the document vs compilers vs what people write)
- 1.6 What "The Standard" Actually Is (the working draft; IS, TS, TR)
- 1.7 How to Read the Standard (clauses, normative text vs notes, stable section labels)
- 1.8 From Standard to Compiler (the path to implementation; the three implementers)

Owns:
- **the standard** (§1.5) - the official ISO document that defines what C++ means; not the compilers, not the code people write.
- **the Delegate's Oath** (§1.2) - the vow: do what's best for the language, make no unnecessary proposals, put users first.
- **the working draft** (§1.6) - the living, in-progress text that becomes the next official version of C++.
- **International Standard (IS)** (§1.6) - the finished, published version of C++, like C++23; the binding standard.
- **Technical Specification (TS)** (§1.6) - an optional, experimental document for trying a feature before it enters the standard.
- **Technical Report (TR)** (§1.6) - an older informational document type, now mostly replaced by the TS.
- **normative text** (§1.7) - the parts that state real requirements, as opposed to notes and examples.
- **stable section labels** (§1.7) - bracketed names like [container.requirements] that stay fixed across drafts, unlike section numbers.
- **the three implementers** (§1.8) - GCC, Clang, and MSVC, the three main compiler teams who turn the standard into something usable.

Prerequisites: none (first chapter). Uses "WG21" plainly (from the intro).
Links: isocpp.org, eel.is/c++draft, github.com/cplusplus/draft. Defer the formal wg21.link explanation to Ch 3. Defer "feature-test macro" to Ch 9.

- **SC22** (§2.2) - the subcommittee under JTC1 for programming languages.
- **WG21** (§2.2) - Working Group 21, the group inside SC22 that writes the C++ standard (formal nesting; used plainly before this).
- **subgroup** (§2.3, shallow) - one of the smaller groups WG21 splits into to do its work. Ch 5 owns the specific rooms.
- **plenary** (§2.3, shallow) - the session where the whole committee meets and makes final decisions. Ch 7 and Ch 8 deepen.
- **National Body (NB)** (§2.4) - a country's official ISO member; its delegates and votes represent that country.

Prerequisites: plenary (Ch 2), the rooms, chair (Ch 5), paper schedule (Ch 3, Ch 5).
Psychological note: the meeting cadence is seductive; don't let attendance become the reward. Go into every discussion skeptical and question the room's priors.

---

## Chapter 8 - How Decisions Get Made

Arc: enters puzzled by how votes work, leaves able to read the room and vote with conviction.

Subheading order (as written):
- 8.1 The Culture of Consensus (not unanimity, absence of sustained opposition; consensus as social pressure)
- 8.2 Straw Polls and the Five-Point Scale

- 8.9 Processing Issues (CWG and LWG)
- 8.10 The Ballot Stages: DIS and FDIS (National Body comments)

Owns:
- **consensus** (§8.1) - general agreement shown by the absence of sustained opposition; not a majority and not unanimity.
- **straw poll** (§8.2) - a non-binding vote on a five-point scale (strongly favor, weakly favor, neutral, weakly against, strongly against) that shows the room's sense.
- **the 2:1 guideline** (§8.3) - the rough rule that a proposal normally advances with about twice as many in favor as against.
- **formal vote** (§8.4) - a binding vote, used at plenary and in ballots, distinct from a straw poll.
- **abstain** (§8.5) - choosing not to vote because you aren't familiar with the issue.
- **direction approval** (§8.6) - an early "we want this" gate.

- **escalation path** (§8.7) - the SD-4 route to bring a disagreement to a higher chair, with a paper.
- **closing plenary** (§8.8) - the Saturday session where subgroups report and adoptions are voted.
- **DIS / FDIS** (§8.10) - the Draft and Final Draft International Standard ballot stages where National Bodies vote.

Prerequisites: plenary, NB (Ch 2); the rooms, CWG, LWG, chair (Ch 5); paper (Ch 3); SD-4 (Ch 3).
Psychological note: consensus is social pressure with a polite name. Keep your wits about you, vote your conviction not the room's momentum, and demand evidence.

- 9.8 A Short Tutorial
- 9.9 Scope and Dependencies (split large papers; omnibus for tiny changes)
- 9.10 The High Bar (burden on the proposer, default no; core language is hard mode; most papers don't make it)

Owns:
- **the Three Pillars** (§9.2) - the habit that a strong paper is example-based, principle-based, and shows alternatives.
- **Tony Table** (§9.4) - a side-by-side before/after table that makes a proposal's value visible.
- **the Steel Man** (§9.5) - the strongest version of the argument against your proposal, which you then answer with evidence.
- **implementation experience** (§9.6) - proof your proposal has been built and used, ideally in more than one place.
- **feature-test macro** (§9.6) - a predefined symbol that lets code check whether a compiler supports a feature.
- **shall / should** (§9.7) - standard-wording verbs: "shall" is a requirement, "should" is advice.

Prerequisites: paper, design review, wording review, SD-4, P2000 (Ch 3); the standard, stable labels (Ch 1); consensus, design approval (Ch 8).
Psychological note: be convinced by overwhelming evidence and nothing else. Go into your own paper skeptical.

- 11.6 Disagreement vs Opposition, and When to Withdraw
- 11.7 How Reputation Works (start small, claim a territory, pick your battles)
- 11.8 The Presenter Is Judged Too (don't cause needless delay; escalation erodes credibility; procedural momentum)
- 11.9 The Long Game (years not months; famous long-running proposals)
- 11.10 The Structural Headwinds (the bandwidth problem; the expert bubble; corporate resource asymmetry)
- 11.11 The Emotional Side (don't take it personally; burnout is real)

Owns:
- **presocialization** (§11.1) - talking to people about your idea in the hallways before you present it.
- **champion** (§11.2, deep) - the person who presents and advocates for a paper, author or not (introduced in Ch 2).
- **back pocket alternative** (§11.5) - a fallback design you keep ready if your first choice is rejected.
- **max-min solution** (§11.5) - the smallest version of a proposal that everyone can accept.
- **re-litigation** (§11.4) - re-debating a question the committee already settled.
- **procedural momentum** (§11.8) - the benefit of the doubt a paper earns from many revisions and prior favorable polls.
- **the bandwidth problem** (§11.10) - there are far more papers than reviewers and time to handle them.
- **the expert bubble** (§11.10) - the tendency for papers to be written by experts for experts.

Prerequisites: paper, design and wording review (Ch 3); the rooms, the Direction Group, chair (Ch 5); consensus, straw poll, direction and design approval (Ch 8); most papers don't make it (Ch 9).
Psychological note: burnout is real, the bandwidth problem is structural, and knowing when to stop is a skill. Set boundaries.

---

## Chapter 12 - C++ Design Principles

Arc: enters wondering why good ideas die, leaves respecting the deep constraints.

Subheading order:
- 12.1 Standardize Existing Practice (the committee's safest path; bless what already works)
- 12.2 Backward Compatibility (the weight of decades of code)
- 12.3 The Zero-Overhead Principle
- 12.4 ABI: The Invisible Constraint (why proposals die on ABI; the Prague ABI vote of 2020)
- 12.5 Freestanding vs Hosted

Owns:
- **standardize existing practice** (§12.1) - the preference for blessing tools that already work over inventing new ones.
- **backward compatibility** (§12.2) - the rule that old code keeps working with new standards.
- **the zero-overhead principle** (§12.3) - you don't pay for what you don't use, and what you use you couldn't hand-code better.
- **ABI (application binary interface)** (§12.4) - the binary contract between compiled pieces of a program; breaking it breaks existing programs.
- **the Prague ABI vote** (§12.4) - the February 2020 decision not to break ABI across the library for C++23, while refusing to promise stability forever. In effect, existing binaries stayed safe and the frozen types stayed frozen.
- **freestanding vs hosted** (§12.5) - two environments: freestanding (no operating system, limited library) and hosted (full library).

Prerequisites: the standard, the three implementers (Ch 1); the implementer veto, the Direction Group (Ch 5).

Owns: no new terms. Restate each referenced term with a short parenthetical.

Prerequisites: draws on every prior chapter.
Psychological note: don't confuse committee participation with impact. A proposal that never ships helped nobody.
